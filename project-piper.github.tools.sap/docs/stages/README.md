# Piper ready-made pipeline

!!! caution "Usage of monorepos"

    Piper ready-made pipelines assume that you have a polyrepo approach.
    Monorepos are not supported although custom specific usage options may exist.

Piper ready-made pipelines offer you ready-made and centrally maintained pipelines for boosting your DevOps efficiency! Pipelines are available in different flavors. So check out what fits your needs.

!!! caution "Prerequisites"

    Before you can use a Piper ready-made pipeline, you need to fulfill the [prerequisites](../prerequisites.md).

## General purpose pipeline

If you are building a standalone cloud application, Piper can support you to rapidly setup and conduct Continuous Delivery in your project. Check out our [general purpose pipeline](gpp/overview.md) to learn more.

!!! note "SAP Cloud SDK pipeline"

    Previously, project "Piper" included also the SAP Cloud SDK pipeline designed specifically for SAP Cloud SDK and SAP Cloud Application Model (CAP) projects.
    SAP Cloud SDK pipeline and its features are merged into the general purpose pipeline as of November 2020.
    The reasoning as well as further information how to adopt the general purpose pipeline are described in following [guide](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/MA/cloud-s4-sdk-pipeline-extensions/blob/master/gpp-guide.md).
