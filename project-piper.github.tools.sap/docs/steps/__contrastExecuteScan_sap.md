## SAP-Specifics

## Prerequisites

You will need a Service Account for running contrastExecuteScan. Please follow this link for creating [Service Account](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/Security-Testing/doc/contrast/getting_started/users/#service-accounts).

Once the service account is created, you will have to configure these secrets - [serviceKey](https://www.project-piper.io/steps/contrastExecuteScan/#servicekey), [username](https://www.project-piper.io/steps/contrastExecuteScan/#username) and [userApiKey](https://www.project-piper.io/steps/contrastExecuteScan/#userapikey).

For **Jenkins** you will have to configure - [userCredentialsId](https://www.project-piper.io/steps/contrastExecuteScan/#usercredentialsid) and [apiKeyCredentialsId](https://www.project-piper.io/steps/contrastExecuteScan/#apikeycredentialsid).

## Example

Follow this example repository to configure contrastExecuteScan for **Jenkins** - [Contrast Piper Demo](https://github.tools.sap/Security-Testing/contrast-piper-demo).
