# Using Azure DevOps Pipelines or Jenkins as a Service?

Azure DevOps as a Microsoft hosted environment is especially suitable for

* larger teams requiring a common CI/CD orchestration environment
* teams without Jenkins knowledge

Jenkins as a Service environment is especially suitable for

* smaller teams requiring dedicated CI/CD orchestrator instances
* teams with Jenkins knowledge which have the need to adapt orchestrator (plugin installations for dedicated purpose, ...)

    If you need more detailed information to decide, have a look at the Hyperspace Academy decision helper on ["Which orchestrator to use?"](https://pages.github.tools.sap/hyperspace/academy/decisionhelp/Orchestrators/).
