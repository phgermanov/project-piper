# Community & Support

!!! success "Piper = Inner Source project"
    With Piper we focus on providing easy to consume Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline functionality which orchestrates shipment tasks that in the past have been executed individually and often manually.

    All pipeline steps provided are convenience functionality to automate tasks.<br />
    **This means: In case of urgency and any failing pipeline steps your shipment is not blocked. You can still provide proof via manual processes.**<br />
    In addition teams using Piper have the flexibility to customize pipeline behavior by for example

    * selecting the Piper version to be used. _master branch is prone to breakages_.
    * activating/de-activating steps
    * replacing/extending pipeline functionality with custom functionality using the power of [Jenkins Pipelines as Code](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline-as-code/)

    Piper is maintained as an inner source project with a core team of a few people.<br />
    That is why support is also set up in a Community approach. There are few piper steps contributed and maintained by teams outside The Tools Team Organization.

    **Please understand that individual support via e.g. email, telephone cannot be guaranteed and is often not feasible!**
