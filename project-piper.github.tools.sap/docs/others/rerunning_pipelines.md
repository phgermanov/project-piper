# Rerunning Pipelines

## Description

This page was created to clarify issues related to pipelines that weren't run as a new, but restarted from existing.

## Clarification

Rerunning pipelines is not supported in Piper, because handling is orchestrator-specific and the impact of reruns on Piper is unpredictable.
Please run every single time a new pipeline.
