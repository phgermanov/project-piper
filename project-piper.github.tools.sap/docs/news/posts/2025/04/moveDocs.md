The Piper documentation has been moved to GitHub Tools and is now available at <https://pages.github.tools.sap/project-piper>!

<!-- more -->

From the previous docs location one will be redirected to the new url automatically.

## 📢 Do I need to do something?

If you have links to specific pages in the Piper documentation, you should update them to point to GitHub Tools instead of GitHub WDF.

<https://github.wdf.sap.corp/pages/ContinuousDelivery/piper-doc/steps/sapCumulusUpload/> -> <https://pages.github.tools.sap/project-piper/steps/sapCumulusUpload/>

## 💡 What do I need to know?

As GitHub Tools is accessible without VPN, the docs are so as well from now on. Also the quick link <https://url.sap/piper> will work without VPN.
